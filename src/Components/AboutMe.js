        <p>
          After following my passion for music and teaching, I am now directing
          my career toward the tech industry. With the pandemic, arts and
          teaching have been put on the back burner for the foreseeable future,
          so being the smart and capable woman I am, I chose a new career path
          that would allow flexibility in where I work, allow me to be creative
          and social, and still work in something I’m passionate about. One
          aspect that the tech industry could offer that teaching really
          couldn’t is growing and being promoted (whether literally or
          figuratively). I am a results-driven professional, so it’s important
          to me to see the impact I am making.
        </p>

          Through my past experiences, I have a high-level of experience in
          recruiting clients, organizing schedules and events, selling my
          product, fundraising, creating something from nothing, managing and
          directing large groups and products, and finding innovative solutions
          to help build and grow companies. These experiences have also
          cultivated my leadership-skills, communication and organizational
          capabilities, problem-solving skills, and a drive to grow and climb. I
          am always setting goals for myself, whether it is to join a social
          media posting challenge for 30 consecutive days or to get a Masters in
          a subject that I am passionate for.

          I bring a colorful and collaborative personality. I take pride in
          having clear visions of the work I want to produce, having excellent
          written and verbal communication, and having the ability to learn
          things quickly. I feel at ease, and most intrigued, in fast paced
          environments. I am exceptionally organized, self-driven, and
          analytical by nature, and I enjoy creative problem solving. My words
          carry weight, I see things through, and I create powerful experiences.
          References might say that I am vibrant, easy to get along with, and
          have strong interpersonal skills. One of my biggest worries is letting
          myself down, so I always find effective solutions to finish what I’ve
          committed to.

          In addition to my love for tech and music, I enjoy outdoor activities
          such as hiking and biking (as long as the uphill is worth the
          downhill!), playing ice hockey (Go Sioux/Hawks!), attending live music
          concerts (secretly wish Taylor Swift was my bff), traveling (San
          Francisco and Prague are some of my favorite places to visit!), and
          spending time with my husband and dog (argue with me that he is not
          the cutest and sweetest dog you’ve ever met!).{" "}
